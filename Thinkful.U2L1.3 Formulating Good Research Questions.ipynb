    "This question is a good one in that there will definitely be statistical evidence to support the rate in 1994.  The only problem is defining juvenile delinquency.  Does juvenile delinquency equate to minors (under 18) who have been arrested by police for a certain offense?  Does it equate to students in schools that have disciplinary action taken against them (detentions, suspensions, etc.)?  A clear definition is needed in order to accurately convey the rate of juvenile delinquency.\n",
